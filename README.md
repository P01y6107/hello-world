# hello-world

Uhm... hi?

Not expecting anyone to ever read this, but oh well. The tutorial said to write a bit about myself, so that's what I'm doing?
I'm me. Just a guy, nothing special. I wish I had done more with coding in my life, but I'm glad I've finally arrived - it's my third career.

In the beginning my presence here will be more boring than watching grass grow, but I've got to start somewhere, right?
